\def\arcsec{\hbox{$^{\prime\prime}$}}

LSST is a telescope.
FRED is undefined but SEMP is defined, as is VO.
We also can stress \emph{SODA} and it should still work.
A non-standard acronym is 2MASS because it has a number in it and FoV has a lower case character.
We also have T\&S for telescope and site and R\&D is also a thing.
