#################################

The ``presentation`` template lets you create new beamer_ presentations using the :ref:`LSST-beamer <lsst-texmf-beamer>` class.

.. seealso::

   For background, see :ref:`templates`.

   For help with using the ``LSST-beamer`` class, see :ref:`lsst-texmf-beamer`.

.. _presentation-template-invocation:

Invoking the template
=====================

After you have :ref:`set up <template-set-up>` cookiecutter and cloned the ``lsst-texmf`` repository, you can create a document by pointing :command:`cookiecutter` at ``lsst-texmf``\ â€™s :file:`templates/presentation` directory.
For example, from a directory containing a ``lsst-texmf`` clone:

.. code-block:: bash

   cookiecutter lsst-texmf/templates/presentation

Cookiecutter will prompt you to configure your document.
