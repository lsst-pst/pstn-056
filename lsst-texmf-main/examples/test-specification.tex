\section{Introduction \label{sect:intro}}
This section should provide an overview of the entire document and a description of the scope of testing.

\subsection{Objectives \label{sect:objectives}}
Test specification document helps in refining the test approach that was planned for executing the test plan. It identifies
the test cases, procedures and the pass/fail criteria for the specific tests. It outlines the actual values required as input parameters
in the testing process and the expected outputs of the testing results. It also identifies the various constraints related to the
test case. \\It is important to note that test cases can be reusable components and one test case can be used in various test designs.\\
The test procedure outlines all the processes that are required to test the system and implement the test cases.

\subsection{Scope \label{sect:scope}}
Define the scope (refining the detailed in the Software Test Plan \citeds{LDM-503}) of the testing whose specifications are
described in this document.

% TASK IDENTIFICATION - APPROACH
%----------------------------------------------------
\section{Approach \label{sect:Approach}}
Describe the approach to be utilized for the software testing specification. It should identify the major activities, methods
and tools that are to be used to test the designated group of features.
\subsection{Tasks and criteria \label{sect:tasks}}
Describe which are the items under tests, as well as criteria to be utilized. Activities should be described in sufficient detail
to allow identification of the major testing tasks and estimation of the resources and time needed for the tests.
\subsection{Features to be tested \label{sect:feat2tested}}
Describe the GENERAL features to be tested.
\subsection{Features not to be tested \label{sect:featnot2tested}}
Describe all the features and significant combinations not to be tested and explain why. If it is not possible to test some
features at their most appropriate level of testing but which will be tested at a later level, this information should be
included here
\subsection{Pass - Fail criteria \label{sect:apppassfail}}
GENERAL criteria to be used to determine whether or not tests are passed.\\
If we agree its always what is in LDM-503 then this is not needed.

\subsection{Suspension criteria and resumption requirements \label{suspension}}
Describe the criteria used to suspend all, or a part of, the testing activities on the test items associated with
the plan, as well as the activities to be repeated when testing is resumed.

% SPECIFICATION DESIGN OVERVIEW

\section{Specification Design Overview \label{sect:design}}
Specify refinements of the test approach described in \citeds{LDM-503} if any.
If not suppress this section .

% NON-TESTING VERIFICATION METHODS TEST DESIGN
\section{\product-VER-XX \label{sect:designid_verification}}

\subsection{Objective \label{sect:VERXXdesignobj}}
This test design includes all the verification methods different to the dynamic testing, needed for the
demonstration of the fulfillment of specific requirements of the DMSR.\\
This includes  the requirements that do not need the execution of the software systems, but a careful document or code inspection, review
or analysis.

\subsection{Features to be tested \label{sect:VERXXtotest}}
Identify the test items and describe the features and combinations of features that are the object of this design
specification. E.g.:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrate that the CU has produced an specific document (e.g. the Software Development Plan)
\item Demonstrate the behavior or value of an specific parameter (e.g. "As a minimum the PPN parameter shall be included in
the global model"
\item Static analysis using tools such as Findbugs or checkstyle, etc.
\item etc
\end{itemize}
The features to be tested depends on the content of the Software Requirements Document. Therefore the above list is just
an example.

\subsection{Approach refinements \label{sect:approach}}
Specify the verification methods to be used to verify the features describe in the section above. These methods are
described in the DM SVTP \citeds{LDM-503}. E.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item Code inspection
\item Document inspection
\item Review
\item Static analysis
\item etc
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test case identification \label{sect:testcaselist}}
List the identifier and a brief description of each test case associated with this design.
We need to agree on the identifiers here .. perhaps they come out of MD ?

\begin{longtable} {|p{0.4\textwidth}|p{0.6\textwidth}|}\hline
{\bf Test Case}  & {\bf Description}  \\\hline
\product-VER-XX-10 & design inspection \\\hline
\product-VER-XX-15 & Code inspection \\\hline
\product-VER-XX-20 & Testing review \\\hline
etc & \\\hline
\end{longtable}
The number and scope of the test cases depend on the requirements to be verified. The list provide above is only an example.

\subsection{Feature pass/fail criteria \label{sect:featpassfail}}
Specify the specific criteria for this design to be used to determine whether the feature or feature combination has passed or failed.

e.g. CU3-IDT-XM-FUN-30,CU3-IDT-ASD-FUN-20.\\
Note that the format is essential for the script that creates the traceability matrices works fine.

\subsubsection{Test items \label{sect:tcitems}}
Identify and briefly describe the items and features to be exercised by this test case (e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item  demonstrate that an
specific document is written or that it contains the information required

case definition. Thus, only a reference to the procedure identification shall be provided. The complete description of
the test procedure shall be given otherwise. \\

Describe any special constraints on the test procedures that execute this test case. These constraints may involve special set
up, operator intervention, output determination procedures, and special wrap up.
